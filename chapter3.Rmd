# 2. Reading the joined dataset

```{r}
alc <- read.table("C:/Data/IODS-project/alc.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```

This is a dataset which contains information on students achievment in two classes, math and Portuguese language. The aim is to see, e.g., how alocohol consumtpion and gender affect students' performance. The name of the variables used can be seen here:

```{r}
colnames(alc)
```

Now we want to study the effect of students' age, number of class failures, health, and absences from the class on students' alcohol consumption. I hypothesize that, except for health, there is a positive relationship between these variables and alcohol consumption. For the health, the relationship is expected to be negative.
